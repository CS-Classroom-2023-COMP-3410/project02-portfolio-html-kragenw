For this, I decided not to use chatgpt very much. I did it to create all of the pages, and the links to get from one to another, but the rest of the content was done by me. This was painful, but I'd rather be learning something. I did use chat for the comments, however. The hardest part was fighting the urge to make it look good. I wound up accidentally using CSS inline, and had to scrap all of that. Figuring out how I can use tables to get certain things exactly where I want was pivotal, and made the whole thing a whole lot easier.
